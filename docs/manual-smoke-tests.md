# Manual smoke tests

Run this by hand before a release, or after touching pty, focus, War Room or
worktree code. Start with `npm run tauri dev`.

A longer scripted War Room scenario lives in [`war-room-demo.md`](war-room-demo.md).

## Basics

- [ ] Launch → one workspace, one terminal; run a command and see output.
- [ ] Split a pane horizontally and vertically; drag the separator; close a
      pane → the tree collapses.
- [ ] Drag a pane header onto another pane → the two swap, shells stay alive.
- [ ] Add / switch / rename / close / drag-reorder workspaces in the navbar.
- [ ] Composer: native folder picker returns the right path, recent folders
      work, agent steppers allocate correctly, the layout preview matches the
      result, `⌘/Ctrl + Enter` creates the workspace.
- [ ] Navbar terminal list: clicking an entry focuses that pane.
- [ ] Close the window → hides to tray (ptys stay alive); tray → Show restores;
      tray → Quit exits and kills every pty.
- [ ] The tray/menu-bar icon shows the box-logo mark (macOS: monochrome
      template that flips with the menu-bar theme; Windows/Linux: the color
      compact tile).
- [ ] Launch a second instance → only focuses the existing window.
- [ ] Custom titlebar renders; dragging it moves the window; edges resize
      (Windows/Linux — macOS uses native traffic lights).
- [ ] Minimize / maximize-restore toggle the right icon state (Windows/Linux).
- [ ] The close button hides to tray without quitting (Windows/Linux).

## Terminal

- [ ] **Truecolor:** run a 24-bit colour CLI → colours are exact, not
      downscaled to 256.
- [ ] **UTF-8:** print emoji, box drawing and accented text in a stream → no
      mojibake.
- [ ] **IME:** type Vietnamese with Telex (or a CJK IME) → no lost or duplicated
      characters; backspace deletes exactly one character, including NFD
      compositions.
- [ ] **Copy/paste:** with a selection `Ctrl/⌘+C` copies; with no selection
      `Ctrl+C` still sends SIGINT; `Ctrl/⌘+V` pastes exactly once.
- [ ] **File drop:** drop a file on a pane → the path is inserted, quoted for
      that pane's shell.
- [ ] **Shell switch:** pick another shell in the pane header → that pane
      respawns with it, other panes are untouched.
- [ ] **Keyboard focus:** click the titlebar / a tab / a pane header, then type
      immediately → characters reach the terminal; Tab triggers shell
      completion instead of walking the focus ring.
- [ ] **Activity dot:** lights while a pane streams output, clears when quiet.

## Terminal links

- [ ] URL: `echo https://example.com` → hover underlines it; a **plain click**
      opens the OS browser and does NOT open the in-app preview column.
- [ ] Drag-select that URL with the mouse → text selects, no browser opens.
- [ ] Absolute path: `ls $PWD/package.json` → plain click does nothing;
      `⌘/Ctrl + click` opens it in the editor.
- [ ] Relative path with line: `echo "src/lib/terminal-links.ts:15:1"` →
      `⌘/Ctrl + click` opens line 15. Then `cd src`, `echo
      "lib/terminal-links.ts:15"` → still resolves (bash/zsh; not PowerShell —
      see Known limits in the README).
- [ ] Non-existent path: `echo "src/lib/does-not-exist.ts:9"` → no underline,
      click does nothing.
- [ ] OSC 8 from an agent: run `claude` in a pane and have it read a file so it
      prints a path → `⌘/Ctrl + click` opens the right file.

## Broadcast and settings

- [ ] `⌘/Ctrl + Shift + B` enters broadcast; `Alt + Click` adds/removes panes;
      typing once reaches every group member; `Esc` exits.
- [ ] Settings → Terminal: changing font / size / line height / ligatures
      updates the preview and every pane.
- [ ] Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts lists the bindings for the current platform.
- [ ] `⌘/Ctrl + B` toggles the sidebar; `Esc` closes Settings.
- [ ] Restart the app → appearance and terminal preferences are remembered.

## Worktrees

- [ ] The "Isolate features in git worktrees" toggle is disabled for a
      non-repository folder (and for a repo with no commits yet).
- [ ] Toggle on + create a workspace with 3 Claude panes → 3 worktree
      directories exist next to the repo, 🌿 badges appear immediately without
      typing a prompt.
- [ ] Broadcast one prompt to the 3 panes → 3 separate, clean diffs on 3
      branches in the Git tab.
- [ ] `worktree.remove` refuses a worktree with uncommitted changes; commit and
      retry → the directory is removed.
- [ ] Create a workspace with the toggle OFF, call `worktree.spawn` → fails with
      "worktree isolation is not enabled".
- [ ] Closing a pane or workspace does NOT delete any worktree.

## Web preview

- [ ] Preview a framing-hostile site: type `github.com` in the address bar —
      the page must render (not a blank frame).
- [ ] Click links inside the page: the address bar URL and tab title follow;
      Back returns and Forward re-advances.
- [ ] Popup handling: on a page that calls `window.open` (e.g. an OAuth
      "sign in" link), the preview navigates in place — no OS window appears;
      Back returns to the opener page.
- [ ] Overlay z-order: with a preview showing, open the workspace-tab context
      menu and the Settings dialog — both must render ABOVE the page (the
      preview hides while they're open, showing the dimmed placeholder).
- [ ] Focus: have an agent call `browser.open_preview` while you type in a
      terminal — keystrokes keep landing in the shell.
- [ ] Resize: drag the panel separator — the page stays glued to the column
      with no white gaps or smearing.
- [ ] Pane switch keeps page state: two panes with previews — switching
      between them must not reload either page.
- [ ] Kill a pane with an open preview: the webview disappears with it; other
      panes' previews are untouched.
- [ ] Welcome z-order: with a preview showing, open Welcome ("+") — the page
      must hide (no native paint over the Welcome page); closing Welcome
      brings the preview back.
- [ ] Switch agent/shell on a pane with an open preview (composer respawn) →
      the address bar clears to its empty state; opening a new URL works and
      shows.
- [ ] Type `exit` in a pane with an open preview, then respawn/restart it →
      same: address bar clears, a new URL opens and shows.

## War Room — basics

- [ ] Drag two agent panes into the War Room tab → member chips appear and an
      intro is typed into each pane.
- [ ] **Probe:** agent A sends a probe → the transcript shows it, idle agent B
      is nudged and reads its inbox.
- [ ] **Execute:** agent A sends execute → the prompt runs in pane B and the
      transcript marks it orange.
- [ ] **Revocation:** drag a chip out or press ✕ → the next tool call from that
      pane is refused with "not in the War Room".
- [ ] **PTY death:** close a member pane → the transcript logs the leave and
      `list_peers` shows no ghost.

## War Room — moderator and typing guard

- [ ] Broadcast a probe from the composer → both panes are nudged; the
      transcript shows one `Moderator → everyone` group with a crown avatar.
- [ ] Direct probe to one member → only that pane is nudged.
- [ ] Switch to Execute → the `Everyone` row disappears, the input turns orange;
      sending a short prompt pastes and runs it in that pane only.
- [ ] An agent sends to `__moderator__` → the reply lands in Discussion and
      nothing is typed into any pane.
- [ ] An agent sends `mode: "execute"` to `__moderator__` → rejected.
- [ ] Type half a line into pane A without Enter, then probe pane A from the
      composer → nothing is typed, the half line is intact, the pill appears in
      pane A, and the Members sub-tab shows `⏸1`.
- [ ] Press Enter in pane A → the nudge arrives right after.
- [ ] Repeat, then click the pill instead → delivered immediately.
- [ ] Repeat, then click into pane B → pane A's pill stays. An unsubmitted line
      holds regardless of focus.
- [ ] Close pane A while a delivery is held → no stray text, no orphan badge.

## War Room — multiple rooms

- [ ] Launch → one "War Room" tab; drag a pane into the panel body → it joins
      that room and the intro names it.
- [ ] `+` creates "Website B"; drag a second pane straight onto the B tab → it
      joins B and the first room is untouched.
- [ ] `war_room.list_peers` from each pane shows only same-room peers, with the
      correct `room` name.
- [ ] Broadcast in room A → room B's transcript receives nothing.
- [ ] Drag a member chip from A onto tab B → A logs Leave, B logs Join
      (pending), the intro is retyped, and the next tool call reconnects.
- [ ] Double-click a tab → rename inline; composer and transcript update at once.
- [ ] Press ✕ on a room with members → two-step confirm → members disconnect,
      the tab disappears, the active room falls back to a remaining one.
- [ ] With only one room left → its tab has no ✕.
- [ ] While viewing room A, queue a message into a pane being typed in in room B
      → tab B shows `⏸N`.

## Claude Code status line

- [ ] Open a workspace with a Claude Code agent pane. Within a few seconds of
      the first prompt the line under the input box reads
      `mcp ✓  ·  ctx <n>k/<n>k <n>%`.
- [ ] A fresh Claude session reads `ctx —` until its first reply.
- [ ] In a plain Terminal pane run `claude --strict-mcp-config` → `mcp …`:
      Claude is alive but never called our server.
- [ ] With a Claude pane running, quit Swarmterm from the tray (Quit, not
      close-to-tray) → the next render reads `mcp ✗`.
- [ ] Run `claude` in a system terminal → the `mcp` segment is absent, only
      `ctx …` renders.
- [ ] Let a session pass 70% context → the `ctx` segment turns amber; past 90%
      → red.
- [ ] Settings → Terminal → Agent status line → off. `statusLine` is gone from
      `~/.claude/settings.json` and every other key survived. Toggle back on →
      it returns, pointing at the current binary.
- [ ] Put your own `statusLine` in `~/.claude/settings.json`, relaunch
      Swarmterm → it is untouched (a warning is logged to the devtools console).
- [ ] Switch a pane's agent (respawns the pty under the same id) → the line
      drops to `mcp …` until the new Claude connects.

## Session resume (composer)

- [ ] Pick a folder with prior Claude Code activity → "Resume sessions"
      (below Recent) lists them newest first, with agent icon, relative
      time, and All/Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode tabs (0-count tabs disabled).
- [ ] More than 6 sessions → "Show all (N)" opens the two-column sessions
      dialog (agent rail + search); ticks made there survive Done/Esc and
      tab switches.
- [ ] More than 5 recent folders → Recent shows 5 + "Show all (N)"; it opens
      the Recent-folders dialog — search filters, clicking a row fills
      Working folder and closes, ✕ removes, Esc/backdrop/Done dismiss.
- [ ] Narrow window → session tabs wrap to a second line; rows truncate.
- [ ] Tick one + Create → the new pane runs `claude … --resume <id>` and the
      old conversation is visible.
- [ ] Folder with no sessions → no "Resume sessions" section, composer
      otherwise unchanged.
- [ ] Uninstall/rename an agent CLI → its sessions disappear from the list.
- [ ] Worktree toggle ON + a ticked session → stepper panes get worktrees,
      the resume pane spawns at the session's original folder.
- [ ] Switch agent on a resume pane via the header dropdown → pane respawns
      fresh (no --resume in the typed command).

## Signed release (macOS)

Run against the `.dmg` produced by `npm run release:mac`, ideally on a Mac that
has never run Swarmterm from source. Details in
[`release-macos.md`](release-macos.md).

- [ ] The disk image opens with no Gatekeeper warning after
      `xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0083;00000000;Safari;" <dmg>`.
- [ ] Dragging to Applications and launching shows no "unidentified developer"
      or "damaged" dialog.
- [ ] A terminal pane spawns and runs `ls`; a split pane spawns a second shell.
- [ ] The web preview column loads `https://github.com`.
- [ ] `echo $SWARMTERM_MCP_URL` inside a pane prints a loopback URL.
- [ ] A War Room message reaches a second pane.
- [ ] Prompts for Desktop/Documents/Downloads access name Swarmterm and carry a
      readable explanation (the `Info.plist` usage strings).

## Windows release

Run against the installer produced by `npm run release:win`, ideally on a
machine that never built Swarmterm. Details in
[`release-windows.md`](release-windows.md).

- [ ] A freshly downloaded `…x64-setup.exe` shows SmartScreen's "Windows
      protected your PC"; **More info → Run anyway** proceeds.
- [ ] Install completes per-user with no admin prompt; the app launches.
- [ ] A terminal pane spawns and runs `dir`; closing the pane leaves no
      orphaned shell in Task Manager.
- [ ] Uninstall via Settings → Apps removes the Start Menu entry.

## Auto-update

Needs two published releases (the older installed locally). Full flow in
[`release-process.md`](release-process.md).

- [ ] Install the previous version; within ~10 s of launch the update toast
      appears bottom-left naming the newer version.
- [ ] **Dismiss** hides it; tray → **Check for Updates…** brings it back.
- [ ] **Download** shows progress; macOS then offers **Restart to update**
      and relaunching lands on the new version (check the tray tooltip /
      About); on Windows the installer runs and the app comes back updated.
- [ ] On the freshly updated build, tray → **Check for Updates…** reports
      "Swarmterm is up to date".
- [ ] With Wi-Fi off, launching the app shows no update UI at all; the tray
      check surfaces a dismissible error toast.

## Telemetry (release builds only)

- [ ] Release build (built with GA keys in `.env.release`): launch, then GA →
      Reports → Realtime shows 1 active user within ~a minute.
- [ ] `npm run tauri dev` (no keys): nothing appears in GA Realtime.

## Agent state detection

- [ ] Claude pane: ask for a long task → dot turns yellow (working) while it runs.
- [ ] Claude pane: trigger a permission prompt (e.g. a Bash command without allow rules) → dot turns red (blocked) within ~1s.
- [ ] Answer the prompt, let the task finish while ANOTHER workspace is active → its workspace tab shows a green dot; switching to it and focusing the pane clears the green.
- [ ] Finish a task while WATCHING the pane → no green dot appears (goes straight to idle).
- [ ] Claude transcript viewer (ctrl+o): state does not flap while it is open.
- [ ] Codex pane: same working / blocked (Action Required) / done pass.
- [ ] OpenCode pane: same working / blocked (Permission required) / done pass.
- [ ] Plain terminal pane: yellow output dot behaves exactly as before.
- [ ] Respawn an agent pane (switch agent) → no stale dot; detection resumes after ~3s.
- [ ] Scroll an agent pane far up during a working task → dot still tracks the live bottom of the buffer.

## Notifications

- [ ] Agent blocks (permission prompt) in a background workspace → chime after ~1 s, no OS banner while the window is focused.
- [ ] Same, but with the window unfocused → chime + silent OS banner ("<Agent> needs your input").
- [ ] Agent finishes in a background pane → completion chime; banner only when window unfocused.
- [ ] Blocked flash that resolves within ~1 s → no chime.
- [ ] Blocked while you are watching that pane → nothing.
- [ ] Settings → Notifications: Sound off → banner still works; System off → chime still works; per-agent off → that agent is fully silent.
- [ ] macOS: first banner triggers the system permission prompt; denying it keeps chimes working.
- [ ] Plain Terminal pane never notifies.
