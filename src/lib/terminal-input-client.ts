/**
 * Turning edits of xterm's hidden textarea into pty input.
 *
 * On macOS a native terminal receives text through NSTextInputClient: the OS
 * hands it whole strings via `insertText:replacementRange:`, however many
 * characters they carry. In a webview the same insertion arrives as a mutation
 * of the hidden textarea, and xterm's keyboard path only carries a subset of
 * those through (see the design spec). This module supplies the missing half:
 * given what has already been written to the pty and what the textarea now
 * holds, it computes the one edit that reconciles them.
 *
 * It also decides, event by event, which side — this layer or one of xterm's
 * own keyboard paths (`_keyDown`'s cancel-and-send, `_keyPress`'s single-char
 * fallback) — is the correct writer for a given keystroke. Letting both write,
 * or neither, is exactly how characters get lost or duplicated; see
 * `ownsMultiCharKey` and `isOrdinaryCharKey`.

 * only needs the boolean, because it now reads the replacement from the
 * textarea itself (see `terminal-registry.ts`).
 *
 * Two separate xterm paths mishandle an event this owns, and the caller must

 *  - `evaluateKeyboardEvent` has no branch for `key.length > 1`, so `_keyDown`
 *    leaves the keydown alone entirely — no cancel, no send. This layer's

 *    insertion produces, and the diff against it can compute real deletions —

 *    be correct for XKey, whose own real Backspace keydowns do the deleting
 *    separately, and was wrong for macOS Telex's tone corrections ("banạn"
 *    instead of "bạn").
 *  - Because `_keyDown` never handled it, `_keyPress` runs next and falls back
 *    to `String.fromCharCode(ev.charCode)` — a single code unit — truncating
 *    the correction to its first character and sending that truncated copy.
 *    The caller's `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` must return `false` for the

 *    calling `preventDefault()`, so the browser's default text insertion (and
