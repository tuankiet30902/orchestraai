 *   is reserved for `browser.open_preview`, i.e. pages an AGENT chose to show.
 *   A misclick costs one stray browser tab, which is cheap enough that the
 *   one-click gesture is worth keeping.
 * - `path` requires Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (win/linux), because it launches an
 *   EXTERNAL editor, which yanks OS focus out of Orchestron entirely. That is the
 *   exact failure terminal-focus.ts exists to prevent, and agent output has far
 *   higher path density than an ordinary shell.
 *
 * Defaults to `path` so the stricter gate applies to any caller that forgets.
