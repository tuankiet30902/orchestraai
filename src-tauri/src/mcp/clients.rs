//! Which panes an MCP client has actually talked to us from.
//!
//! The `mcp` segment of the status line answers "did Claude load our config?",
//! and the only honest evidence is an inbound request carrying the pane's
//! bearer token. Env-var presence proves nothing (the env is injected whether
//! or not Claude ever reads `~/.claude.json`), and `OrchestronMcpServer::caller`
//! is too late — it only runs for `#[tool]` invocations, while `initialize` is
//! both the first request Claude Code sends and the one that proves the link.
//! So this set is fed from a transport-level middleware instead.
//!
//! Membership is monotonic for a pane's lifetime: it answers "has a client ever
//! reached us", not "is one attached right now". Liveness would mean accounting
//! for held SSE streams inside rmcp's session manager, and the state worth
//! surfacing is the *absence* of a client, which a set already tells us.
